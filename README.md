# Welcome to 86Hands! 🙌

86hands is a Google Chrome extension voice assistant extension that gives users a new way of interacting with their computer. This extension allows users to speak their commands, and have their browser adhere to it the same way it would using a keyboard and mouse. The goal of this project is to give users more options in the area of user input, and expand the usual human-computer interaction methods to new heights! This project was a submission for the first annual SharkByte hackathon!

**Features**

- **Real-time voice monitoring**: Monitor's the users voice and listens for keywords to activate.
- **Phrase-based activiation**: Requires certain phrases to be spoken to activate command requests.
- **Speech Parsing and analysis**: Analysis user's voice to determine intended commands/actions
- **Command translation**: Correlates user keywords in speech to browser commands.
- **Visual Feedback**: Status switch allows users to easily enable and disable the microphone. Microphone symbol on display on applicable browser tabs.
